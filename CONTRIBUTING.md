Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Quick start

- Create a branch from `main`.
- Add tests for any bug fix or behavior change.
- Run checks locally before opening a PR.

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repo and clone your fork.
2. Create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b my-change
```

3. Make changes.
4. Run package checks.
5. Open a pull request with a clear description and, if applicable, example input/output.

## Reporting issues

Please include:

- R version and platform
- Minimal reproducible example
- Expected vs. actual behavior

## Code style

- Prefer clear, explicit code over clever code.
- Keep user-facing errors informative.
- Keep dependencies minimal.
